/**
 * This package contains all the elements currently interpreted by the JT parser.
 * Classes in this packages should be named according to the object names as in the 
 * /JTViewer/src/main/resources/object_type_identifiers.txt
 * file. This way they will be automatically picked up and used for parsing. 
 * Each class contains its specific attributes, inheriting from the appropriate class, and 
 * overrides the {@link uk.ac.liv.jt.format.JTElement#read()} read method implementing 
 * the specific reading functionality.
 * Most segment types in JT have a single element, of one type; the LSGSegment actually contains all the 
 * logical graph structure and makes use of most of the JTNode types in this package.
 * <p>
 * See 
 * {@link uk.ac.liv.jt.format.JTElement} class for the static loading of the elements and default read method.
 * See 
 * {@link uk.ac.liv.jt.format.JTNode} class for the base of all the Graph nodes.
