/**
 * This package contains the segment types found in JT files, as listed by the JT Table of Contents.
 * 
 * Segments then contain the different elements that constitue the contents of a JT file.
 * 
 * The class LSGSegment is fundamental for parsing JT files, as it contains the Logical Scene Graph that
 * organises all the Elements in the file, and for this reason the methods to interpret the graph 
 * and create a JReality scene representation are contained there.
